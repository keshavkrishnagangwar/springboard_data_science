    "This project attempts to forcast the conversion of cognitively normal and persons with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to a diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Alzheimer's Disease is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders in North America. In Canada alone, there are 564,000 people diagnosed with dementia, a number that is expected to increase to nearly a million by 2031.Aside from the impact on an individual, dementia places a large burden on the healthcare system and persons involved with an affected individual. Dementia is currently estimated to cost 10.4 billion dollars in yearly expenses within Canada.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early diagnosis of AD is associated with a higher quality of life and a reduced cost on a healthcare system. However, detecting AD early in the disease progression is difficult due to the multifaceted nature of how neurodegeneration affects the brain, cognitive processing, and behavior. Clinical evaluation relies on assessment of a myriad of cognitive tests and biomarkers that are not always identifiable in patients with MCI, a precursor to AD. \n",
    "\n",
    "The multifaceted impact of cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration in MCI and AD suggests that machine learning algorithms such as neural networks may be beneficial in identifying and predicting disease progression. Current studies typically only incorporate one form of data, however, often relying solely on features extracted from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Other forms of data that show promise in classification with machine learning algorithms include cognitive assessments and the connectivity patterns of resting-state functional networks. This is because spatial and episodic memory, cognitive processes that are typically the first affected in MCI and AD, rely on complex, dynamic interactions of distributed neural networks and are therefore susceptible to the impact of neurodegeneration. Critically, there has yet to be an assessment of how machine learning algorithms perform using features extracted from structural and functional MRI data, as well as cognitive assessments. This project aims to remedy this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target audience and use cases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Healthcare providers. Structural and resting-state functional MRIs are one of easiest and fastest methods of brain imaging. Using them to classify persons at risk or with AD would assist in providing targeted treatments."

    "In this section, we'll look at how volumetric brain measurements from the structural MRIs differ (or not) between the diagnosis categories. The measurements in the dataset are either cross sectional (denoted with an x) or longitudinal (denoted with an l). Cross sectional data points are generated by segmenting a patient's scan using a common template. This provides a volumetric estimate of brain regions that can then be compared between groups, as the segmentation is relative to a constant across all patients. The longitudinal data is done within subject, meaning that a template is generated for each patient and changes in brain morphology are calculated relative to that template. This provides a more reliable estimate of how an individual's brain changes over time, but is more time intensive to generate, which is why there is less of these done in the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it is generally thought that the larger a brain structure is, the better it is able to perform the cognitive functions associated with it. There are caveats to this, in that the volume of a brain region needs to be normalized by the volume of the whole brain (some people just have bigger brains), and that there are upper bounds to the volume = skill relationship. For the hippocampus, however, there are studies showing that larger hippomcampi results in better memory performance. For example, see the following publication.\n",

    "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can produce a number of metrics. The two of interest in the dataset are fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). DTI characterizes the diffusion of water molecules in the brain. The core idea for the current study is that non-random diffusion is present when there are neuronal axons, as the white matter on an axon causes water to diffuse in a linear manner. FA represents a deviation from random diffusion of water molecules in a structure and is taken as a measure of the structural integraty of a brain region. High values of FA indicate more integrity. FA values in the hippocampus have been shown to correlate with spatial memory performance. See the publication:\n",

    "It appears that in some cases, such as patient 166, that there is a conversion to MCI that is coded as a conversion to AD. This is evident because they enter the study as CN, convert to AD but remain stable as MCI, then later convert again to AD. In other cases, such as patient 4947, there appear to be wrong entries (index 9750) in the dxchange column. Because the patients who convert to AD are critical to our model, we'll go through each of these and fix them one by one."
